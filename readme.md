# Foliage-Shadow-Imposter

#### There was no good Nanite Shadow Imposter demonstration on Internet while l wrote this paper. So, l thought, why didnâ€™t l make one?

The idea is to increase performance by replacing dynamic shadow-casting foliage with shadow imposters and non-shadow casting foliage and disabling expensive World Position Offset shadow on selected foliage and replace it with a static shadow imposter of the current mesh.

DisplayMap2 is built with WPO foliage with dynamic shadow; DisplayMap3 is built with WPO foliage with static shadow imposter.<br />
Run through the forests till the end, the density gets higher the further you go. <br />
Simple weather change, time change, and Landscape replacement functions are also implemented(see belowðŸ‘‡).

#### Have Fun!

#### key mapping:
```java
W, A, S, D: move

Z: Go to DisplaMap2(dynamic shadow map)
X: Go to DisplayMap3(shadow imposter map)

C, V, B, N, M: set scalability, c being low(lowest), m being cinematic(highest)

R: change time, adding 6 hours in 1 second
T: change time, adding 6 hours in 20 second
Y: move forward by 30 mins
U: move backward by 30 mins

L: swap realistic Landscape with a simple one
K: swap simple Landscape with a realistic Landscape

1, 2, 3, 4: change weather (clear skies, cloudy, rainy, snowy)

Esc: quit game
```
