This is a performance comparison demo. DisplayMap2 would be WPO foliage with dynamic shadow, and DisplayMap3 would be WPO foliage with static shadow imposter.
Try run through the forests till the end, the density gets higher the further you go. I also implemented weather and time change functions.

Have Fun!



key mapping:

W, A, S, D: move

Z: Go to DisplaMap2
X: Go to DisplayMap3

C, V, B, N, M: set scalability, c being low(lowest), m being cinematic(highest)

R: change time, adding 6 hours in 1 second
T: change time, adding 6 hours in 20 second
Y: move forward by 30 mins
U: move backward by 30 mins

L: swap realistic Landscape with a simple one
K: swap simple Landscape with a realistic Landscape

1, 2, 3, 4: change weather (clear skies, cloudy, rainy, snowy)

Esc: quit game
